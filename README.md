# DNA
Reads a file resource and looks for DNA sequences using start
and stop codons. The program creates a storage resource then
• prints all the Strings in storage resource that are longer than 9 characters
• prints the number of Strings in storage resource that are longer than 9 characters
• prints the Strings in storage resource whose C-G-ratio is higher than 0.35
• prints the number of strings in storage resource whose C-G-ratio is higher than 0.35
• prints the length of the longest gene in storage resource
